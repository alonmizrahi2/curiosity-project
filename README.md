# Curiosity project

In this project we will use the concept of curiosity in order to enable the models to learn in a smarter way, in a way that maximizes our success.

Part 1: Solving a classification problem using Naive Bayes, without a curious aspect and with a curious aspect.

Part 2: Solving a classification problem using an artificial neural network, when we will test the sensitivity of the network to changes in the architecture.

Part 3: Curiosity loop, using the RL algorithm, find an optimal artificial neural network architecture.
